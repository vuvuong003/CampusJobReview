### Introduction
Are you considering an on-campus job but unsure what to expect? Or have you worked or are currently working in one and want to share your experience to help your peers in their job search?

Our newly enhanced Campus Job Review System is a one-stop destination for students seeking answers about on-campus jobs. This comprehensive platform empowers students by allowing them to upload and explore reviews of various job opportunities. Built with Django and MongoDB, the system benefits from Django's rapid development capabilities and MongoDB's flexibility in managing diverse review data.

After visiting our website, students will leave with a fresh perspective, reassured that their questions have been addressed. By leveraging insights from peers who have firsthand experience, they can make informed decisions about their on-campus employment options.

Explore our platform and take the first step towards finding the right on-campus job for you!

### Newly Enhanched Features
We have made lots of changes to ensure that our app is feasible, maintainable, extendable, and can be used by a broad audience. Throughout this process, we have extended various features and fixed bugs. Our enhancements and bug fixes include:

1. Database Migration: We have migrated the current minimal SQL to MongoDB. This ensures enhanced performance, particularly with faster queries for dynamic filtering, while also improving scalability.

2. Frontend Upgrade: We migrated from foundational HTML/CSS to React for a more dynamic and responsive user experience, providing a seamless, real-time interface that better meets user needs.

3. Security Enhancements: We have implemented secure login and sign-up processes by improving authentication mechanisms through JWT tokenization, which allows for secure access to job reviews and user data.

4. Browser Extension: We have integrated a browser API with the cloud MongoDB database to allow for job review pop-ups and form autofill when viewing or applying for jobs, minimizing repetitive data entry and enhancing job search ease.

5. Enhanced User Interaction: We added dynamic filters for pay rate, ratings, job locations, and more, allowing users to sort various fields for a more focused and personalized approach to their job searches.
