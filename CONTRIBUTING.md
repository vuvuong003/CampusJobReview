## Issues and PRs. How to Contribute. 
 
We would love to hear suggestions on any improvements on this project. Please begin by opening an issue to talk about any enhancements, bug fixes, documentation updates, etc. 
We love hearing contributions or addressing any questions, so feel free to ask and contribute!

The next step would be to open a PR after talking about the suggestion or bug fix in the issue. Follow these steps for submitting a PR: 

1. Fork and clone the repository.
2. Configure and install the dependencies: [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/SAT510/CampusJobReview/blob/test/INSTALL.md).
3. Make sure that the test pass on your local machine by using `pytest`
4. Make your changes in a new branch: `git checkout -b my-branch-name`
5. Check for any regressions and fix these issues
6. Push to your fork and submit a pull request.
7. Great Job! Now, all you got to do is wait for your pull request to be reviewed and merged. 


Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:
- Follow the style guides, style checkers, syntax checker, and coding standards that are in the README as badges. These include bandit, autopep, pylint, and black. You can run this indivudally on your local machine to ensure that no errors are shown. 
- Ensure that you have tested your change by adding more tests and ensuring there is no regression. 
- Make sure that you make one change at a time. Submit a pull request for each change to ensure smooth merging and avoiding any merge or oher conflicts. 
- Add and commit your changes with a good commit message.  

## How can you break the system?
- Pushing code that is not working locally 
- Pushing code without doing rigorous testing 
- Not fixing the static analysis errors before pushing
- Not following the installation instructions found in [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/SAT510/CampusJobReview/blob/test/INSTALL.md) to ensure all dependencies are met
