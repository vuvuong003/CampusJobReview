|Workload is spread over the whole team (one team member is often Xtimes more productive than the others)|  |  | | |
|but nevertheless, here is a track record that everyone is contributing a lot)| |
| Number of commits | | | | |
| Number of commits: by different people| | | | |
| Issues reports: there are many | | | | |
| Docs: doco generated, format not ugly | | | | |

| Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing | | | | |
| Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code | | | | |
| Use of version control tools | | | | |

| Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people) | | | | |
| Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer) | | | | |
